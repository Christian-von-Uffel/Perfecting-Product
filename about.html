<p>
Perfecting Product serves to discover, highlight, and implement effective product strategy.

We do this by performing research, testing ideas, and writing about results.

Key to our mission is the first principle of our company philosophy:

<b>"If you would like to improve something, first ask how you should measure it"</b>

The first challenge we help software businesses overcome is measurement. We help businesses measure success and failure, so they can prioritize development and do what work is worth doing.</p>
