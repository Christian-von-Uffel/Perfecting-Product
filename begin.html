  I built and launched my first website using Github pages.

PerfectingProduct.com

Building the website was a simple personal project for me.

I've worked with a number of software companies on marketing and product, but few people appreciate how hard it is to build even small things.

In order to get a better sense and understanding of how hard building software can be, I chose to write this website from scratch. Not a difficult task for full-time web developers, but something few people actually do themselves.

You'd think most people creating websites for a living would know how to write website code themselves, but you'd be wrong.

Most websites today are built using templates or platforms like Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace.

I built this website by hand knowing that it would force me to do two things:

1. Improve my planning process for building things using code
2. Help me identify what work's worth doing by directly confronting typical software development tradeoffs like effort vs ROI
